CS109_Final_Project
===================

This is the final project for CS 109, Data Science, a course taught at Harvard. This project was taken in a group. The goal of the project was to use a network modeling approach to try and study tourist flows in the United States. In particular, we hoped to model tourist flows in the united states and to then leverage network centric properties like centrality of the different cities, to potentially predict a traveller's next step. 


Details.
The data is a series of blogs, 50000,  from travelblog. In this case, if a traveller visits more than one city we draw an edge between these cities. As the traveler continues to visits these places we eventually obtain a weighted graph capturing tourist flows. 

Using network properties such as pagerank, betweenness centralities, and others we hoped to predict a traveler's next step. Most of my work in this final project was focused on the network modeling aspect.
