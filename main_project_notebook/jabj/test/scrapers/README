This directory contains tests and test data for scrapers.  Each test
has an id, a test script, and an associated input file.  db contains
mappings of test numbers to the url used to retrieve the sample.

Each test number should also have a t_XXXX.py file (for example, the
first test was t_0000.py).  Each t_000.py should have two variables,
"scraper" and "expected".  The top-level test script will run all of
the tests, passing the data to the scraper and insuring the output is
expected.

The workflow is to find a page you want to scrape, save it to the next
numeric ID, and write a test for it.
